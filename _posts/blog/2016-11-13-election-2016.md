This map shows states that Trump and Clinton  won for electoral votes in 2016, and it also shows the unemployment rate (UER) for every county in the US 50. The scale starts at 0-2% and increases in increments of two, the highest unemployment rate ranges from 10-25%. The mean and max unemployment were very similar for Trump (4.9%, 21%) and Clinton (4.8, 22%), but the spread among states is noticeably different.

States and counties with unemployment rates >10%  tended to favor Trump. Trump state counties were peppered with areas where unemployment higher than 10%. Surrounding these areas are a number of counties where unemployment rates were 8-10%. Almost 2% (0.01694) of counties in Trump states had unemployment rates > 10%, while less than 1/3 of 1% of counties (2 out of 618) in Clinton's states had an unemployment rate higher than 10%. Imperial County and Tulare County are both in California, which went to Clinton, but Trump won the popular vote in Tulare County.
