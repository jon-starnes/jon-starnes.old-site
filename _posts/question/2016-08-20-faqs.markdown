#### What is open data?  
Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.

#### How does this site use open data?
This site exclusively uses open data for all analysis examples. Furthermore, this site's posts will make available both the code and the source of the data used in its examples.

#### Where can I find more sauce and open data?
I'm actively collecting sources on accessible machine-readable open data and plan to post all that I have found into a 'Resources' page on this site. In the meantime, the [Open Access Directory (OAD) list](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Data_repositories) is a good place to launch into exploring open access data.
