What is open data? What does that mean? The concept has been around since before the days of GPL and open source requirements, but the formal definition is relatively new. Open data is data that can be accessed and used for any reason by anyone, subject only to the social contract authority of attribution to the originator or author and the share and share alike contract.

[http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/](Open Definition 2.0) gives the following summary for the 'open' concept:  

> "Knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it â€” subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness."  

This site is a personal site for data science projects that uses open access data. Grokking with Open Data (GIOD), a name and statement if you will, acknowledges open data initiatives in the US and across the world as sources of inspiration and data materials. GIOD seeks to lead by example which is why all data and sources featured here will be made readily available.  

As more content is added and involvement grows, one hopes that it can serve as a conduit for others to engage with and actively use open data resources.
