#### Open Data Repositories
This list is starting small because I am only including sites where data is immediately transparently easy to see and readily available. I'm personally curating the list and not resorting to a web scrape and dump.

The two sites below are simply a starter list. This section will grow and be maintained going forward.

1. AWS Public Data Sets  
  [https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/](https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/)  

2. The Bureau of Labor Statistics  
  [http://www.bls.gov/data/](http://www.bls.gov/data/)  


If you have any open data sites to suggest please email me or contact me (See the contacts and social media at the bottom of the page).
