#### Open Data Repositories
---  

This list is starting small because I am only including sites where data is immediately transparently easy to see and readily available. I'm personally curating the list and not resorting to a web scrape and dump. The two sites below are simply a starter list.  

---  


1. AWS Public Data Sets  
  [https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/](https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/)  

2. The Bureau of Labor Statistics  
  [http://www.bls.gov/data/](http://www.bls.gov/data/)  

3. Kaggle Datasets  
  [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

4. The Dathub  
  [https://datahub.io/dataset](https://datahub.io/dataset)
